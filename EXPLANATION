let’s break down the entire code step by step so you understand every line, concept, and flow of your hybrid sorting algorithm. We’ll go deep but keep it clear. Ready? Let’s go.

🔍 Overview

You're implementing a hybrid sorting algorithm called StepwiseSort that does:

🧩 Shell Sort (with Knuth's gap) for small arrays (n ≤ 10,000)

⚡ Parallel Merge Sort (using Java Fork/Join) for large arrays (n > 10,000)

🧠 Recursive parallelism to take advantage of multi-core CPUs

✅ Part 1: Entry Point — stepwiseSort(int[] arr)
public static void stepwiseSort(int arr[]) {
    int n = arr.length;

    if (n <= PARALLEL_THRESHOLD) {
        shellSort(arr);
    } else {
        parallelMergeSort(arr);
    }
}

🧠 What It Does:

Gets the array size n

If size is ≤ 10,000, it uses shellSort() — efficient for small arrays

If > 10,000, it uses parallelMergeSort() — faster for large arrays via parallelism

This is the hybrid decision logic — the core of your adaptive algorithm.

✅ Part 2: shellSort(int[] arr)
private static void shellSort(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length;
    int step = 1;

    while (step < n / 3) {
        step = 3 * step + 1; // Knuth's sequence: 1, 4, 13, 40...
    }

🧠 What It Does:

Shell Sort uses a gap-based insertion sort

Starts with a gap (called step) between elements

step = 3*step + 1 is Knuth’s sequence, known to perform well in practice

    while (step > 0) {
        for (int i = step; i < n; i++) {
            int key = arr[i];
            int j = i;

🧠 Inner Loop:

For each step, it loops from that position till end

Think of it like insertion sort but comparing elements step apart

            while (j >= step && arr[j - step] > key) {
                arr[j] = arr[j - step]; // shift larger elements right
                j -= step;
            }
            arr[j] = key; // insert in correct position
        }
        step /= 3; // decrease gap
    }
}

🧠 Final Steps:

Once insertion is done for this gap, reduce step and repeat

When step becomes 1, it’s a normal insertion sort

When step is 0, sorting is done

✅ Shell Sort = efficient for small to medium arrays with better cache use than Merge or Quick Sort

✅ Part 3: parallelMergeSort(int[] arr)
private static void parallelMergeSort(int[] arr) {
    ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
    pool.invoke(new MergeSortTask(arr, 0, arr.length - 1));
}

🧠 What It Does:

Creates a ForkJoinPool (Java’s parallel thread pool)

Submits a task: MergeSortTask, which recursively sorts the array

Parallelism is handled internally by the pool

✅ Part 4: MergeSortTask — The Recursive Parallel Sort
static class MergeSortTask extends RecursiveAction {
    private static final int SEQUENTIAL_THRESHOLD = 1000;
    private final int[] arr;
    private final int left, right;

    MergeSortTask(int[] arr, int left, int right) {
        this.arr = arr;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }

🧠 Class Setup:

This is a ForkJoin task — a unit of work that can run in parallel

RecursiveAction means it returns nothing

It stores:

arr = array to sort

left = start index

right = end index

    @Override
    protected void compute() {
        if (right - left <= SEQUENTIAL_THRESHOLD) {
            Arrays.sort(arr, left, right + 1); // small subarray? sort sequentially
            return;
        }

🧠 Recursive Sorting:

If the subarray is small (≤ 1000), use regular Arrays.sort() (no parallelism)

Why? Fork/Join overhead isn’t worth it on tiny data

        int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        invokeAll(
            new MergeSortTask(arr, left, mid),
            new MergeSortTask(arr, mid + 1, right)
        );
        merge(left, mid, right);
    }

🧠 Forking Work:

Splits array into two halves

Recursively calls invokeAll() to process both in parallel

Then merges the two sorted halves

✅ Part 5: merge() Function
private void merge(int left, int mid, int right) {
    int[] temp = Arrays.copyOfRange(arr, left, right + 1);
    int i = 0, j = mid - left + 1, k = left;

🧠 Setup:

Copies the subarray into temp[]

i points to left half, j to right half

k is the index for placing back into arr

    while (i <= mid - left && j <= right - left) {
        arr[k++] = (temp[i] < temp[j]) ? temp[i++] : temp[j++];
    }
    while (i <= mid - left) arr[k++] = temp[i++];
    while (j <= right - left) arr[k++] = temp[j++];
}

🧠 Final Merge:

Standard merge logic:

Pick smaller of two values

Move pointers accordingly

Finish remaining values from both halves

✅ This is a standard merge step used in Merge Sort
