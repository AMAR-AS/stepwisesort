# StepwiseSort

StepwiseSort is an optimized sorting algorithm that combines stepwise reduction with a hybrid sorting approach to enhance performance. It adapts the step size for sorting smaller datasets efficiently and switches to Javaâ€™s built-in MergeSort for larger datasets to ensure optimal execution speed.

## Features
- **Adaptive Step Size**: Efficiently sorts small datasets.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines custom sorting with Java's MergeSort for optimal performance.
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle both small and large datasets effectively.

## Usage
To use the StepwiseSort algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AMARNU/stepwisesort.git
   ```

2. Include the algorithm in your Java project.

3. Run the algorithm with your dataset:
   ```java
   StepwiseSort.sort(yourDataset);
   ```
