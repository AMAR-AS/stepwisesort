# stepwisesort
The Stepwise Sort algorithm is an optimized sorting technique that integrates stepwise reduction and a hybrid sorting approach to enhance performance. It utilizes an adaptive step size for sorting smaller datasets efficiently, switching to Javaâ€™s built-in MergeSort for larger datasets to ensure optimal execution speed.
