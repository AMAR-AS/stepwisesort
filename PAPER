Abstract
Sorting is a fundamental operation in computing, widely used in database management, data processing, and system optimization. This paper presents Stepwise Sort, a hybrid algorithm integrating Knuth’s Sequence-based step reduction, Shell Sort principles, and Parallel Merge Sort via Java’s Fork/Join framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid approach improves efficiency over existing sorting methods such as QuickSort, Merge Sort, and Shell Sort while maintaining adaptability across large datasets.

1. Introduction
Sorting algorithms have been extensively studied in computer science due to their importance in data organization and retrieval. Traditional sorting techniques such as Merge Sort, QuickSort, and Shell Sort exhibit varying performance characteristics. Merge Sort is highly efficient for large datasets but lacks adaptability for smaller collections. QuickSort offers fast average-case performance but suffers from instability in worst-case scenarios. Shell Sort improves insertion-based sorting but lacks parallelization capabilities.
This paper introduces Stepwise Sort, a hybrid adaptive sorting algorithm combining Shell Sort’s stepwise logic, Merge Sort’s scalability, and parallel processing techniques. By integrating Knuth’s Sequence for step reduction, the algorithm achieves improved sorting performance, especially in large datasets.
2. Related Work
Several sorting algorithms have been optimized through hybrid methodologies in recent research:
Shell Sort ([1]) implements incremental step sorting but lacks parallel execution.
Merge Sort ([2]) provides a stable O(n log n) complexity but lacks adaptability for small datasets.
Parallel Sorting Approaches ([3]) utilize multi-threading to enhance performance in large-scale applications.
Unlike previous methods, the Stepwise Sort Algorithm uniquely blends stepwise reduction, binary insertion, and parallel execution, creating a novel hybrid adaptive approach.
3. Methodology
3.1 Adaptive Step Reduction Using Knuth’s Sequence
Instead of fixed n/2 step size reduction, we apply Knuth’s Sequence (3x + 1) dynamically, optimizing sorting efficiency by reducing unnecessary passes.
3.2 Parallel Merge Sort Execution
For datasets exceeding 5,000 elements, Merge Sort is triggered using Java’s Fork/Join framework, leveraging multi-core parallelism for efficient computation. 				
3.3 Algorithm Implementation
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool;
import java.util.concurrent.RecursiveAction;

class StepwiseSort {
    public static void stepwiseSort(int arr[]) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int step = 1;
        while (step < n / 3) { step = 3 * step + 1; }

        while (step > 0) {
            for (int i = step; i < n; i++) {
                int key = arr[i];
                int j = i;
                while (j >= step && arr[j - step] > key) {
                    arr[j] = arr[j - step];
                    j -= step;
                }
                arr[j] = key;
            }
            step /= 3;
        }

        if (n > 10000) { parallelMergeSort(arr); }
    }

    private static void parallelMergeSort(int[] arr) {
        ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
        pool.invoke(new MergeSortTask(arr, 0, arr.length - 1));
    }

    static class MergeSortTask extends RecursiveAction {
        private final int[] arr;
        private final int left, right;

        MergeSortTask(int[] arr, int left, int right) {
            this.arr = arr;
            this.left = left;
            this.right = right;
        }

        @Override
        protected void compute() {
            if (left >= right) return;
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            invokeAll(new MergeSortTask(arr, left, mid), new MergeSortTask(arr, mid + 1, right));
            merge(left, mid, right);
        }

        private void merge(int left, int mid, int right) {
            int[] temp = Arrays.copyOfRange(arr, left, right + 1);
            int i = left, j = mid + 1, k = 0;
            while (i <= mid && j <= right) { arr[left + k++] = (temp[i - left] < temp[j - left]) ? temp[i++ - left] : temp[j++ - left]; }
            while (i <= mid) arr[left + k++] = temp[i++ - left];
            while (j <= right) arr[left + k++] = temp[j++ - left];
        }
